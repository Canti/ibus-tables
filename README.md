ibus tables for inputting IPA

I am in the process of learning IPA and required a way to input it.
I searched around and found the ipa-x-sampa table by M. Fabian. X-SAMPA is far more than I need right now.
Furthermore, I found many of the bindings to be counter-intuitive, so I decided to make my own table.
For now I have simply modified the ipa-x-sampa table by adding additional bindings for basic IPA consonants and vowels
that made more sense to me than x-sampa's original bindings, while keeping all of the original bindings, too.

I will use the table I have made and make modifications as seem sensible after practical usage. If the original x-sampa
bindings hamper me, I will create a basic IPA table from scratch.

Some IPA symbols are bound to multiple keys to make them easy to find for users who might have different ideas on
which keys they should be bound to.
